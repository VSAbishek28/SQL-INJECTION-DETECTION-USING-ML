 🛡️ SQL Injection Detection Using Machine Learning

🔍 Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to detect **SQL Injection attacks** in web application queries. By learning patterns from both legitimate and malicious SQL statements, the system can effectively flag potential threats, ensuring enhanced web application security. It is designed for real-time detection with minimal false positives.
